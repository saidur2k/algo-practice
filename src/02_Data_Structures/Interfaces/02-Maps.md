#Maps

Maps are quite similar to simple JavaScript objects. 

Maps are a set/collection of keys that have values associated with those keys. 

Maps, or dictionaries as they are sometimes referred to, are key-value sets.

When a value of a key is updated, the previous value is lost.

Unlike objects, they don't have prototypes, inheritance, methods, or anything of that sort. 

Maps are also similar to associative arrays in other languages. 

Again, since the keys are a set, there cannot be duplication of keys.

You can have duplication of values though. 

Key 'thing' can have value 'map' while key 'other thing' can have a value of 'map' as well.

Maps don't have any sense of order.
