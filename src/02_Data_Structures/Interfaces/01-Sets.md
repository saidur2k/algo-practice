#Sets

A set is pretty simple aka collections depending which language you're working with. 

A set allows at least four things: 
- add,
- remove,
- contains, and 
- toList. 

The basic idea is that you can add items to a set and then later check if they're there. 

You can also request later a list of those items in the set. 
- Though with no guaranteed order; sets have no notion of order.

They're also useful for de-duplication since you can only add something to a set once.
